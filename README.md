# STUDAL

STUDAL is a comprehensive GUI application that I developed in my second year of Engineering, designed to assist students in managing their daily tasks and schedules. 
It was developed using Python's TKinter Library for GUI and OpenPyxl for data management.

STUDAL aims to simplify students' lives by offering a suite of useful features like to-do lists, time-table and student statistics.

It also provides easy access to things that are used by students daily like academic calendars, books, etc.

For the study material, we used the web-browser library of Python through which we redirected the user to a link where we can upload and access the study 
material. Also, we used the OpenCV library to view things like academic calendars.

In addition to all of this, we have also added a games section where a student can come and play fun games like 
TIC-TAC-TOE and SOS games so that students can relax from their daily schedule.
