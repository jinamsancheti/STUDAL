# STUDAL

STUDAL is a comprehensive GUI application which I developed in my second year of Engineering, designed to assist students in managing their daily tasks and schedules. Developed using Python's TKinter Library for GUI and OpenPyxl for data management. 

STUDAL aims to simplify students life by offering a suite of useful features like to-do-lists, time-table and students statistics.

It also provides easy access to things that are used by students on a daily basis like academic calender, books, etc.

For study material we used the web-browser library of Python through which we redirect the user to link where we one can upload and access the study material.
Also we used OpenCV library to view things like academic calender.

In addition to all of this we have also added a games section where a student can come and play fun games like TIC-TAC-TOE and SOS game so that student can relax from their daily schedule.
